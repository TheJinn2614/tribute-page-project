    <p>
      Queen were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal,
      however they gradually transitioned into a more conventional and
      radio-friendly genre by assimilating different musical styles such as
      arena and pop rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before creating Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor had previously played
      together in a band called
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_(band)"
        >Smile</a
      >. <br />
      Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more
      elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested
      the name "Queen". Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band
      released their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the
      UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974.

      Queen have been a global presence in popular culture for more than four
      decades. Estimates of their record sales range from 170 million to 300
      million, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. They
      have been described as one of the most influential bands of the 20th
      century, and have also been detailed as one of the most successful rock
      bands of all time.
